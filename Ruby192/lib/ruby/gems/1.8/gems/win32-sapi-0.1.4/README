   Ruby 1.8.2 or later.

== Constants
SAPI5::VERSION
	The current version of this package.
	
== Notes
   This module is a simple interface to the Microsoft Speech API 5.1.  There
   are interfaces to all of the Automation classes that this API consists of.
   Each class is a subclass of the SAPI5 class, which is in turn a subclass
   of WIN32OLE. With your object you can then call the available methods for
   that particular Automation class.

   This documentation won't offer the complete documentation for every method.
   Instead, download the Microsoft Speech API 5.1 documentation (a .chm file)
   and read the part that covers 'Automation'.
	
== Known Bugs
   None known. Any bugs should be reported on the project page at
   http://rubyforge.org/projects/win32utils.
	
== Acknowledgements
   Thanks go to Jouke Visser for his Win32::SAPI5 Perl module, on which this
   library is based.
