= Description
   This is a drop-in replacement for the Win32API library currently part of
   Ruby's standard library.
	
= Synopsis
   require 'win32/api'
   include Win32
   
   buf = 0.chr * 260
   len = [@buf.length].pack('L')
   
   GetUserName = API.new('GetUserName', 'PP', 'I', 'advapi32')
   GetUserName.call(buf, len)
   
   puts buf.strip
   
= Differences between win32-api and Win32API
   * Argument order change. The DLL name is now last, not first.
   * Removed the 'N' and 'n'. Always use 'L' for longs now.
   * Sensible default arguments for the prototype, return type and DLL name.
   * Reader methods for the function name, prototype, return type and DLL.
   * Removed the support for lower case prototype and return types. Always
     use capital letters.
   
= Developer's Notes
   The current Win32API library that ships with the standard library has been
   slated for removal from Ruby 2.0 and it will not receive any updates in the
   Ruby 1.8.x branch. I have far too many libraries invested in it to let it
   die at this point.
   
   In addition, the current Win32API library was written in the bad old Ruby
   1.6.x days, which means it doesn't use the newer allocation framework.
   There were several other refactorings that I felt it needed to more closely
   match how it was actually being used in practice.
   
   The first order of business was changing the order of the arguments. By
   moving the DLL name from first to last, I was able to provide reasonable
   default arguments for the prototype, return type and the DLL. Only the
   function name is required now.
   
   There was a laundry list of other refactorings that were needed: sensical
   instance variable names with proper accessors, removing support for lower
   case prototype and return value characters that no one used in practice,
   better naming conventions, the addition of RDoc ready comments and,
   especially, callback support.
   
   Most importantly, we can now add, modify and fix any features that we feel
   best benefit our end users.
