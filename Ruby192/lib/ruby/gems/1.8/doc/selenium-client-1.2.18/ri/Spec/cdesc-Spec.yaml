  contents: 
  - !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::LI 
    label: "*"
    body: Changed execution_error to be an instance variable (in lieu of a local variable).
  - !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::LI 
    label: "*"
    body: Introduced an unique id (example_uid) that is the same for a real Example (passed in after(:each) when screenshot is taken) as well as the corresponding ExampleProxy (passed to the HTML formatter). This unique id gives us a way to correlate file names between generation and reporting time.
