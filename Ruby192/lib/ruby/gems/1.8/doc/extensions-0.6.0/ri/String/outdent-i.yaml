  body: Outdents the string <tt>n</tt> spaces. Initial tabs will cause problems and cause a warning to be emitted (if warnings are on). Relative indendation is always preserved. Once the block hits the beginning of the line, that's it. In the following example, <tt>.</tt> represents space from the beginning of the line.
