  body: An ArgForwarder is associated with a <em>target</em>. It forwards messages sent to it to the target, passing along any arguments to the method. So far, so boring. But an ArgForwarder is also created with some <em>added_args</em>. When the ArgForwarder forwards, it prepends those <em>added_args</em> to the message's given arguments.

  body: "  array = []\n  forwarder = ArgForwarder.new(array, 5)\n  forwarder.push\n  assert_equal([5], array)\n"
