  body: Treat <em>filename</em> as the configuration file. <em>filename</em> is expected to be in the home directory. The home directory is found in the same way Rubygems finds it. (First look in environment variables <tt>$HOME</tt>, <tt>$USERPROFILE</tt>, <tt>$HOMEDRIVE:$HOMEPATH</tt>, file expansion of <tt>&quot;~&quot;</tt> and finally the root.)
