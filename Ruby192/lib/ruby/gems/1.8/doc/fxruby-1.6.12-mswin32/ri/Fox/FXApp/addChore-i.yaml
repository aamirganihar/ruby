- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: "Add a idle processing message to be sent to a target object when the system becomes idle, i.e. when there are no more events to be processed. There are several forms for #addChore; the original form (from FOX) takes two arguments, a target object and a message identifier:"
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::VERB 
  body: "    app.addChore(tgt, sel)\n"
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: If a chore with the same target and message already exists, it will be rescheduled.
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: "A second form takes a Method instance as its single argument:"
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::VERB 
  body: "    app.addChore(mthd)\n"
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: For this form, the method should have the standard argument list for a FOX message handler. That is, the method should take three arguments, for the message <em>sender</em> (an FXObject), the message <em>selector</em>, and the message <em>data</em> (if any).
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: "The last form takes a block:"
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::VERB 
  body: "    app.addChore() do |sender, sel, data|\n        ... handle the chore ...\n    end\n"
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: "All of these return a reference to an opaque FXChore instance that can be passed to #removeChore if it is necessary to remove the chore before it fires."
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: For the last two forms, you can pass in the optional +:repeat+ parameter to cause the chore to be re-registered after it fires, e.g.
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::VERB 
  body: "    chore = app.addChore(:repeat =&gt; true) do |sender, sel, data|\n        ... handle the chore ...\n        ... re-add the chore ...\n    end\n"
