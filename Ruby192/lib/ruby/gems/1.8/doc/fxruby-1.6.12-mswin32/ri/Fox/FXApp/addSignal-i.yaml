  body: Add signal processing message to be sent to target object when the signal <em>sig</em> is raised; flags are to be set as per POSIX definitions. When <em>immediate</em> is <tt>true</tt>, the message will be sent to the target right away; this should be used with extreme care as the application is interrupted at an unknown point in its execution.
