<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
This library allows for the identification of a file&#8216;s likely <a
href="../classes/MIME.html">MIME</a> content type. This is release 1.25.1,
fixing an issue with priority comparison for mime-types 1.x. The current
release is 2.0, which only supports Ruby 1.9 or later.
</p>
<p>
Release 1.25.1 contains all features of 1.25, including the experimental
caching and lazy loading functionality. The caching and lazy loading
features were initially implemented by Greg Brockman (gdb). As these
features are experimental, they are disabled by default and must be enabled
through the use of environment variables. The cache is invalidated on a
per-version basis; the cache for version 1.25 will not be reused for any
later version.
</p>
<p>
To use lazy loading, set the environment variable
<tt>RUBY_MIME_TYPES_LAZY_LOAD</tt> to any value other than
&#8216;false&#8217;. When using lazy loading, the initial startup of <a
href="../classes/MIME/Types.html">MIME::Types</a> is around 12–25×
faster than normal startup (on my system, normal startup is about 90 ms;
lazy startup is about 4 ms). This isn&#8216;t generally useful, however, as
the <a href="../classes/MIME/Types.html">MIME::Types</a> database has not
been loaded. Lazy startup and load is just <b>slightly</b> faster—around
1 ms. The real advantage comes from using the cache.
</p>
<p>
To enable the cache, set the environment variable
<tt>RUBY_MIME_TYPES_CACHE</tt> to a filename where <a
href="../classes/MIME/Types.html">MIME::Types</a> will have read-write
access. The first time a new version of <a
href="../classes/MIME/Types.html">MIME::Types</a> is run using this file,
it will be created, taking a little longer than normal. Subsequent loads
using the same cache file will be approximately 3½× faster (25 ms) than
normal loads. This can be combined with <tt>RUBY_MIME_TYPES_LAZY_LOAD</tt>,
but this is <b>not</b> recommended in a multithreaded or multiprocess
environment where all threads or processes will be using the same cache
file.
</p>
<p>
As the caching interface is still experimental, the only values cached are
the default <a href="../classes/MIME/Types.html">MIME::Types</a> database,
not any custom <a href="../classes/MIME/Types.html">MIME::Types</a> added
by users.
</p>
<p>
<a href="../classes/MIME.html">MIME</a> types are used in <a
href="../classes/MIME.html">MIME</a>-compliant communications, as in e-mail
or HTTP traffic, to indicate the type of content which is transmitted. <a
href="../classes/MIME/Types.html">MIME::Types</a> provides the ability for
detailed information about <a href="../classes/MIME.html">MIME</a> entities
(provided as a set of <a href="../classes/MIME/Type.html">MIME::Type</a>
objects) to be determined and used programmatically. There are many types
defined by RFCs and vendors, so the list is long but not complete;
don&#8216;t hesitate to ask to add additional information. This library
follows the IANA collection of <a href="../classes/MIME.html">MIME</a>
types (see below for reference).
</p>
<p>
<a href="../classes/MIME/Types.html">MIME::Types</a> for Ruby was
originally based on <a href="../classes/MIME/Types.html">MIME::Types</a>
for Perl by Mark Overmeer, copyright 2001 - 2009.
</p>
<p>
<a href="../classes/MIME/Types.html">MIME::Types</a> is built to conform to
the <a href="../classes/MIME.html">MIME</a> types of RFCs 2045 and 2231. It
tracks the <a href="http://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/">IANA
registry</a> (<a href="ftp://ftp.iana.org/assignments/media-types">ftp</a>)
with some unofficial types added from the <a
href="http://www.ltsw.se/knbase/internet/mime.htp">LTSW collection</a> and
added by the users of <a href="../classes/MIME/Types.html">MIME::Types</a>.
</p>
<h2>Synopsis</h2>
<p>
<a href="../classes/MIME.html">MIME</a> types are used in <a
href="../classes/MIME.html">MIME</a> entities, as in email or HTTP traffic.
It is useful at times to have information available about <a
href="../classes/MIME.html">MIME</a> types (or, inversely, about files). A
<a href="../classes/MIME/Type.html">MIME::Type</a> stores the known
information about one <a href="../classes/MIME.html">MIME</a> type.
</p>
<pre>
    require 'mime/types'

    plaintext = MIME::Types['text/plain']
    # returns [text/plain, text/plain]
    text      = plaintext.first
    puts text.media_type            # =&gt; 'text'
    puts text.sub_type              # =&gt; 'plain'

    puts text.extensions.join(&quot; &quot;)  # =&gt; 'txt asc c cc h hh cpp hpp dat hlp'

    puts text.encoding              # =&gt; quoted-printable
    puts text.binary?               # =&gt; false
    puts text.ascii?                # =&gt; true
    puts text.obsolete?             # =&gt; false
    puts text.registered?           # =&gt; true
    puts text == 'text/plain'       # =&gt; true
    puts MIME::Type.simplified('x-appl/x-zip')
                                    # =&gt; 'appl/zip'

    puts MIME::Types.any? { |type|
      type.content_type == 'text/plain'
    }                               # =&gt; true
    puts MIME::Types.all?(&amp;:registered?)
                                    # =&gt; false
</pre>
<h2>Contributing</h2>
<p>
I value any contribution to <a
href="../classes/MIME/Types.html">MIME::Types</a> you can provide: a bug
report, a feature request, or code contributions.
</p>
<p>
Code contributions to <a href="../classes/MIME/Types.html">MIME::Types</a>
are especially &lt;del&gt;welcome&lt;/del&gt;encouraged. Because <a
href="../classes/MIME/Types.html">MIME::Types</a> is a complex codebase,
there are a few guidelines:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Changes (aside from new <a href="../classes/MIME.html">MIME</a> types)
&lt;strong&gt;will not&lt;/strong&gt; be accepted without tests. The test
suite is written with MiniTest.

</li>
<li>Match my coding style.

</li>
<li>Use a thoughtfully-named topic branch that contains your change. Rebase
your commits into logical chunks as necessary.

</li>
<li>Use <a
href="http://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html">quality
commit messages</a>.

</li>
<li>Do not change the version number; when your patch is accepted and a release
is made, the version will be updated at that point.

</li>
<li>Submit a GitHub pull request with your changes.

</li>
<li>New features require new documentation.

</li>
</ul>
<h3>Test Dependencies</h3>
<p>
To run the test suite, you will need to install the development
dependencies for <a href="../classes/MIME/Types.html">MIME::Types</a>. If
you have Bundler, you can accomplish this easily:
</p>
<pre>
    $ bundle install
</pre>
<p>
<a href="../classes/MIME/Types.html">MIME::Types</a> uses Ryan Davis’s
excellent <a href="https://github.com/seattlerb/hoe">Hoe</a> to manage the
release process, and it adds a number of rake tasks. You will mostly be
interested in:
</p>
<pre>
    $ rake
</pre>
<p>
which runs the tests the same way that:
</p>
<pre>
    $ rake test
    $ rake travis
</pre>
<p>
will do.
</p>
<h3>Workflow</h3>
<p>
Here&#8216;s the most direct way to get your work merged into the project:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Fork the project.

</li>
<li>Clone down your fork (+git clone
git://github.com/&lt;username&gt;/mime-types.git+).

</li>
<li>Create a topic branch to contain your change (+git checkout -b
my_awesome_feature+).

</li>
<li>Hack away, add tests. Not necessarily in that order.

</li>
<li>Make sure everything still passes by running `rake`.

</li>
<li>If necessary, rebase your commits into logical chunks, without errors.

</li>
<li>Push the branch up (+git push origin my_awesome_feature+).

</li>
<li>Create a pull request against halostatue/mime-types and describe what your
change does and the why you think it should be merged.

</li>
</ul>
