  body: "Returns whether message will be marked for deletion. If so, the message will be deleted at session close (i.e. after #find exits), but only if also using the #find_and_delete method, or by calling #find with :delete_after_find set to true."
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: "Side-note: Just to be clear, this method will return true even if the message hasn't yet been marked for delete on the mail server. However, if this method returns true, it *will be* marked on the server after each block yields back to #find or #find_and_delete."
