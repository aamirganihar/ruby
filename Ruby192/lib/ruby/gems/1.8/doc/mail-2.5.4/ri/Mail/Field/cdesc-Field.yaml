  body: " 2.2. Header Fields\n\n    Header fields are lines composed of a field name, followed by a colon\n    (&quot;:&quot;), followed by a field body, and terminated by CRLF.  A field\n    name MUST be composed of printable US-ASCII characters (i.e.,\n    characters that have values between 33 and 126, inclusive), except\n    colon.  A field body may be composed of any US-ASCII characters,\n    except for CR and LF.  However, a field body may contain CRLF when\n    used in header &quot;folding&quot; and  &quot;unfolding&quot; as described in section\n    2.2.3.  All field bodies MUST conform to the syntax described in\n    sections 3 and 4 of this standard.\n"
