  body: "  mailbox: mailbox to search the email(s) in. The default is 'INBOX'.\n  what:    last or first emails. The default is :first.\n  order:   order of emails returned. Possible values are :asc or :desc. Default value is :asc.\n  count:   number of emails to retrieve. The default value is 10. A value of 1 returns an\n           instance of Message, not an array of Message instances.\n  read_only: will ensure that no writes are made to the inbox during the session.  Specifically, if this is\n             set to true, the code will use the EXAMINE command to retrieve the mail.  If set to false, which\n             is the default, a SELECT command will be used to retrieve the mail\n             This is helpful when you don't want your messages to be set to read automatically. Default is false.\n  delete_after_find: flag for whether to delete each retreived email after find. Default\n          is false. Use #find_and_delete if you would like this to default to true.\n  keys:   are passed as criteria to the SEARCH command.  They can either be a string holding the entire search string,\n          or a single-dimension array of search keywords and arguments.  Refer to  [IMAP] section 6.4.4 for a full list\n          The default is 'ALL'\n"
