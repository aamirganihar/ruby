  body: " 2.2.1. Unstructured Header Field Bodies\n\n    Some field bodies in this standard are defined simply as\n    &quot;unstructured&quot; (which is specified below as any US-ASCII characters,\n    except for CR and LF) with no further restrictions.  These are\n    referred to as unstructured field bodies.  Semantically, unstructured\n    field bodies are simply to be treated as a single line of characters\n    with no further processing (except for header &quot;folding&quot; and\n    &quot;unfolding&quot; as described in section 2.2.3).\n"
