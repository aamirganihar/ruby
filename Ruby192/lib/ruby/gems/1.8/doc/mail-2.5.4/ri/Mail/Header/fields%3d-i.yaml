  body: " 3.6. Field definitions\n\n  It is important to note that the header fields are not guaranteed to\n  be in a particular order.  They may appear in any order, and they\n  have been known to be reordered occasionally when transported over\n  the Internet.  However, for the purposes of this standard, header\n  fields SHOULD NOT be reordered when a message is transported or\n  transformed.  More importantly, the trace header fields and resent\n  header fields MUST NOT be reordered, and SHOULD be kept in blocks\n  prepended to the message.  See sections 3.6.6 and 3.6.7 for more\n  information.\n"
